## About me 

In the academic side of my life, I am a student pursuing my AAS in IT at Northern Essex Community College. On the professional side, I've been in the industry for just about three years now and have been extremely fortunate to be able to work in a field that I am so passoinate about. Currently I work at a school district as a Junior Systems / Network Adminstrator and really enjoy networking. I am studying for the CCNA and hope to one day pursue a career at a NOC!
