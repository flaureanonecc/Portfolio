-- About me --

In the academic side of my life, I am a studuent pursuing my AAS in IT at Northern Essex Community College. On the professional side, I've been in the industry for just about three years now and have been extremely fortunate to be able to work in a field that I am so passoinate about. Currently I work at a school district as a Junior Systems / Network Adminstrator and really enjoy networking. I am studying for the CCNA and hope to one day pursue a career at a NOC!

1 Biggest Challenge so far?

Bash scripting has been my biggest challenge so far. I have only used bash scripting for another intro to linux course before but that was some time ago so I havent touched it since. The scripting aspect has really been pushing me become more comfortable with it. 

2 Moment you were most proud of so far.

The moment I'm most proud of is overcoming these scripting challenges. They have not been easy for me and the scripting portion of the assignments always takes the longest time for me because of my inexperienced with the language.

3 One thing you will do to improve for the second half of the class.
(edit: Please make this a concrete plan, don't say "Work harder" or "Work more" try for something like "I will do X amount of time per week" or "I will go to tutoring once a week" type of thing)

I am really going to put a ton of extra effort into becoming more comfortable with creating scripts with linux. At my job, we only have a few linux servers but they either sftps, imaging server, or database so I never interact directly with the commandline aspect of the servers. Scripting is the lifeblood of any linux adminstrator though so I will need to improve my ability with it.

4 One new thing you've learned so far

I learned that Linux handles it's networking much more differently than Windows. The most interesting thing is because there are many different types of linux distros, they do not all handle networking the same which is a stark difference from how Windows handles their networking.

5 One thing you want to add or change to make this portfolio better for the final

I want to try to clean up the appeareance of the portfolio, maybe throw in some html to make it more readable and pretty. I think that the way it looks now is fine but I can upgrade the apperance of it which would make it more attractive to prospective employers.
